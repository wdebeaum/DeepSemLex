  "Given a path expression and a list of input concepts (or values in general,
   but this is mostly intended for concepts), return the list of output
   concepts reachable from the input concepts via paths matching the
   expression.

   If the input is a hash table instead of a list, its keys are taken to be the
   input concepts, and its values are lists of paths back from those concepts
   to the original input for the whole expression. Paths alternate between
   concepts and basic steps. Then this function returns a new hash table in the
   same format for the output concepts.
   
   Path expressions are similar to those in WordNetPath, but are S-expressions
   instead of strings, and operate mainly on slots and relations instead of
   WordNet pointers (though WN pointers can be relations too).
   
   Path expression components:
     Seed:
       resource::concept-name
     Basic steps:
       >label - follow relations with this label forwards, getting targets
       <label - backwards
       ->label - forwards, getting the relations themselves
       <-label - backwards, getting relations
       slot-name - get the slot value for each concept (note that this does not
	 flatten list-valued slots like a function would; if you want that,
	 follow it with #'identity)
       #'function-name
       (lambda (concept) lisp code...) - call the function and use the returned
	 list of concepts as the output. If the return value isn't a list, wrap
	 it in a list.
     Sequencing and repetition:
       (1 exprs...) - follow the exprs in sequence exactly once
	 (exprs...) also works if the first subexpression doesn't conflict with
	 the other operators
       (? exprs...) - zero or one times
       (+ exprs...) - one or more times
       (* exprs...) - any number of times
       (repeat m n exprs...) - between m and n times, inclusive
       (repeat m nil exprs...) - at least m times
     Predicates:
       (when exprs...) - keep those input concepts for which anything is
         reachable via the sequence of exprs
       (unless exprs...) - keep those input concepts for which nothing is
         reachable via the sequence of exprs
     Set operations:
       (& exprs...) - the output is the intersection of the outputs of the
         exprs evaluated on the same input
       (/ exprs...) - union
       (- exprs...) - difference (the first expr is positive, the rest are
         negative)
